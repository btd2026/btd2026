## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an Agentic AI project for a Global Consulting firm to support Digital Identity (RBAC) iniatives. Users can use natural languate to transform Workday HR data it into a visual hierarchy diagram. Leveraged Anthropic MCP in a Docker container to translate natural language into query functionality. Developed documentation to support ongoing development of the project in the Consulting company. Projected to reduce a 4 week RBAC role assignment process to a few chats and couple minutes.
- âš¡ Also working on an AI powered live translator application.
